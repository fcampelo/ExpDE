- add standard alpha and beta values to BLX-alpha-beta
- Document new mutation operators (like in the paper)
- check error message for is_within() (see, for instance, recombination\_onepoint)  
- Add flag _record.everything_ to _ExpDE()_ (to return the whole history of the 
optimization, incl. intermediate populations)
- Consider expressing candidate solutions as lists (useful to encapsulate 
meta-info about each vector in the population).
- Add 'offspringnumber' option to the recombination routines (to simplify reuse, 
    e.g., for RCGAs or other extensions)
- think about using a standard notation for parameters in all recombination 
    operators (is it interesting or will it generate more confusion?)
- "There is a problem in the absence of verification of variables of the function, maxevals and maxiter, if they are numeric. Please look at this. Att, Valmor Ricardi Junior"
